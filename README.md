## DNS 32

A work-in-progress DNS Adblocker powered by a low power ESP32 chip that sits in your home network, and saves you from distracting and manipulative ads.

Inspired by [esper](https://github.com/zachmorr/esper/), [ESP32_Adblocker](https://github.com/s60sc/ESP32_AdBlocker/), as well as the venerable [pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole) and other Raspberry Pi friendly projects.

This is currently being built as part of a [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) batch project.
